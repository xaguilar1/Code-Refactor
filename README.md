# Code-refactor

Overview: 

- simple computer website from scratch using HTML and CSS refactoring it to look more appealing

What i did: 
-cleaned up the HTML & CSS file
-added semantic tags
-added an icon to the title
-made a better title
-added alt tags for images
-added some description of each code
-made the content in each box flow together (such as main content and aside content being adjacent to each other when showing full screen & not one section shorter than the other) *im probably OCD
-made all top links reference their section (there was one that didnt at first)
