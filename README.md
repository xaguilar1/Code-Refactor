# homework1-refactor

* this is my first homework,

What i did: 
-cleaned up the HTML & CSS file
-added semantic tags
-added an icon to the title
-made a better title
-added alt tags for images
-added some description of each code
-made the content in each box flow together (such as main content and aside content being adjacent to each other when showing full screen & not one section shorter than the other) *im probably OCD
-made all top links reference their section (there was one that didnt at first)

How i felt about this homework:
- I felt like it was probably going to be the easiest homeworks we would get, although I still had trouble with CSS when i would try to make it more concise.
-realized i would get confused with the <div> tags and <section> tags and which one to use,
-in CSS , id's and classes are not confusing, though when typing them out in the CSS file, that is when it gets tricky for me.
-Overall, good homework, good support, and ready for the next one.
